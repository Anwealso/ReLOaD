## TODO

New Approach
- Build an environment class and function that can replicate the internal state and progression of the igibson env
- Plot this in matplotlib or pygame to visualise how it works
- Hook up the TF-Agents rl agent up to this and let it train for a bites
- (STRETCH) Wrap it into a gym environment to allow for quicker porting of the agent code to igibson later

Basic model
- Want basically a 2D grid world simulation built in pygame
- Add some walls as obstructions
- Put in moving robot and static objects
- Add trails showing path of robot
- Save screenshots of the completed environment every couple of episodes 

Factors to include in detection function
- Distance
- Angle off frontal
- Size of object
- Obstructions
